## README  --  Double Pendulum

This directory has methods for deriving the equations of motion of a double pendulum; automatically writing function files for computing the dynamics, kinematics, and energy; running simulations; and animation.

EoM_Double_Pendulum.m  --  This is the tutorial script for generating the equations of motion.

MAIN_doublePendulum.m  --  This script is used to run a simulation and then an animation of the double pendulum.
