## README  --  Matlab Derivation of Mechanical System Equations of Motion

This directory contains matlab code for deriving the equations of motion of a few standard (conservative) mechanical systems. Each example also contains an entry-point method (MAIN_systemName.m) which will run a simulation and generate some plots or an animation.
