## README  --  Simple Pendulum

The bulk of this tutorial for deriving the equations of motion for the single pendulum are in EoM_Single_Pendulum.m. This script then writes functions for computing the dynamics, kinematics, and energy for the pendulum. 

MAIN_singlePendulum.m can be used to run a simulation of the penulum and make some plots.
