### README.md

This directory contains the Matlab code to automatically derive the 
equations of motion for a point mass that is connected to the origin by
a force actuator.

MAIN.m will run a simulation of the system with a nonlinear controller 
that is working to maintain a constant distance between the origin and the
point mass.
